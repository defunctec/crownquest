CrownQuest started as an experiment to create a Crown economy inside Minecraft and we have not only demonstrated how Crown and Blockchain technology can be best game money in the world, but started the best community of players and collaborators we could ever hope for.

We’re excited to announce that CrownQuest 2.0 Beta testing has started, This is a complete rewrite of the project that works as a Spigot plugin, and completely Open Source under the Apache-2.0 License.

You can check the official repository here: [https://github.com/crownquest/crownquest](https://github.com/crownquest/crownquest)

That means the game mechanics and economy are completely transparent, we'll be open to collaborations via pull requests to improve the game, everyone is welcome to fork and make their own Minecraft servers fuelled with the power of Crown as an in-game economy.

We want to thank the folks at [Xapo](http://xapo.com), [BlockCypher](http://blockcypher.com) [Xeyler](https://github.com/Xeyler), the CrownQuest Slack and [Mego](http://mego.cl) for helping on this huge re-launch.

We’re hoping to see you on the brand new CrownQuest.
Merry Christmas!!
