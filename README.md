# Forked from "BitQuest", thanks to explodi.

# CrownQuest

[CrownQuest](http://crownquest.co/) is a Minecraft mod that connects the game economics to a Crown or other cryptocurrency nodes. It creates a Crown wallet for every user that connects to the server, plus a common "loot" wallet used for rewards to players when killing mobs.

Players also can purchase land plots and stacks of items, transferring coins to the loot wallet, thus redistributing the spent cryptocurrency within the players.

You can use CrownQuest to host your own Minecraft crypto server.

# Official Servers

* Coming soon

# Important Note
This project is an experiment and not a commercial product, bugs can, and most likely will happen. Please report any bugs to a moderator promptly, to ensure they are fixed. Also note that your wallet is not guaranteed, and you may experience issues with your balance. For this reason, it is highly recommended that you do not deposit large amounts, or anything you do not wish to place at risk by being tied to the server. In addition, if you are caught breaking rules and are banned, you forfeit your access to your server wallet, and all funds tied to it. With this said, rules are non-negotiable, and will be strictly enforced. This server is a fair server, and anyone abusing any system set in place will be punished. Please play fair, have fun, and enjoy the server

# How it works?
## Everyone is a Crown wallet
The [CrownQuest](https://comingsoon.com) server and every player has a crown address. Any player can receive and send crown to any address inside or outside the game. This is useful for buying materials, selling crafts, trading, tipping, etcetera.

## And there's loot!
Every time a player kills an enemy (mob) there is a chance to get loot. If that is the case the server makes a transaction directly from the server address to the player address and the player is notified.

## Everyone can send money anywhere
You can send Crown to an external wallet with /transfer:
```
/transfer <amount> <recipient-crown-address>
```

Additionally, players can send Crown to other players via /send:
```
/send <amount> <username>
```

## Server address
The CrownQuest server has it's own address, used for giving Loot to players.

# Building the CrownQuest Java Plugin
You can build the crownquest Java plugin if you wantt to contibute to the code (all pull requests are welcome) or if you want to run your own server.

## 1. Requirements

1. Update system
```sh
apt update
```
2. Java JRE+SDK (Version 1.8) and Maven
```sh
sudo apt install -y openjdk-8-jre openjdk-8-jdk maven
```


## 2. Compile CrownQuest and generate a JAR file
There is a maven project that will download the spigot 1.12.2 (downloading the latest version will be automated in future):

```sh
mvn package -B
```

Or using all of your cpu core (fastest)
(If you have low ram your build can crash)
```sh
mvn package -B -T 1C
```

# Contibuting
Before submitting a pull request, please format the code in google style.
You can easly format the code by doing (you can exec this script from anywhere (you can do ../../../../../build.sh if you where on src/java/main/crownquest/crownquest/)):

```sh
./format.sh
```

# Running a CrownQuest server with Docker

You can use Docker to run a CrownQuest server. The recommended way to configure is using the docker-compose.yml file that can link to a directory where the worlds are stored. An example is included here. 

## Configuration

Configuration can be done via enviroment variables:

| environment variable            | description                                                            |
|---------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| CROWNQUEST_ENV                  | Set to 'production' to enable main net transactions.                   |
| CROWNQUEST_NODE_USERNAME        | username for Bitcoin node                                              |
| CROWNQUEST_NODE_PASSWORD        | password for Bitcoin node                                              |
| CROWNQUEST_NODE_HOST            | IP to a bitcoin node with JSON-RPC interface enabled                   |
| ADMIN_UUID                      | Minecraft user ID for the main administrator                           |

# Run docker
Run within the crownquest folder
```sh
docker-compose up
```
